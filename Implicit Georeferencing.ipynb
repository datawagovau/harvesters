       " u'notes': u'These images were created to remove the water glint from the original aerial photography image delivered by Landgate over the Busselton and the Leeuwin tiles captured in 2012. This technique did create some errors which have been masked with a land, intertidal and surf zone mask. In the rare case that errors are still present the deglint images must be interpreted with the original aerial photography images (see Source Data Enhancement) in the background to confirm the visual interpretation. \\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent location:\\r\\nfile://kens-nas-010/gis mapped as Windows disk K\\r\\n\\r\\nK:/rs_imagery/Aerial_photography/CAPES/2012',\n",

    "# Harvesting WMS into CKAN\n",
    "This notebook illustrates harvesting of a WMS endpoint into a CKAN instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "The harvested WMS endpoint belongs to Landgate's Spatial Land Information Program (SLIP). The layers within are authored by partner agencies or Landgate. There are one or several different web service endpoints per WMS layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Organisations\n",
    "From a spreadsheet of agency references, names, and further information, CKAN organisations are initially created and subsequently used as owners of the respective harvested WMS layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topics\n",
    "The WMS layers are organised by topics, which will be created both as CKAN groups and keywords. Harvested datasets will be allocated to releveant CKAN groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layer names\n",
    "The WMS layer names contain the layer ID, consisting of agancy slug and layer reference, and the publishing date, and will be split up during harvesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional resources\n",
    "Additional web service end points, as well as a list of published PDFs with further information, are added as extra resources to the CKAN datasets from harvested WMS layers."

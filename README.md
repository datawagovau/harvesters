# Harvesting scripts for data.wa.gov.au

This repo contains the iPython Notebooks used to harvest WMS and ArcGIS REST endpoints into 
[data.wa.gov.au](http://data.wa.gov.au/) and its test site, 
[catalogue.alpha.data.wa.gov.au](http://catalogue.alpha.data.wa.gov.au/).

The harvesting process follows some highly customised rules which change too often
to make the customisation of a ckan harvesting extension feasible and maintainable.

The Python notebooks aim to serve as an example of scripted harvesting to other CKAN maintainers.
We do not accept any liability for consequences of incorrect use.
With great power comes great responsibility!
